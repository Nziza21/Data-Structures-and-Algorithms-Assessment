## Challenge Tasks

### Stacks:

**Question 1:** Implement a function `is_balanced(expression)` that checks whether a string containing parentheses, curly braces, and square brackets is balanced.

Example:

```python
expression1 = "([]{})"
expression2 = "([)]"
print(is_balanced(expression1))  # Output: True
print(is_balanced(expression2))  # Output: False
